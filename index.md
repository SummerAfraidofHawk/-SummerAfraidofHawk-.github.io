# Background

<p> I am a senior, attending Oglala Lakota College.  I will be graduating with my B.S. Natural Science emphasis Conservation Biology.  I am an ESIIL Star Intern and the Herd Development Grant Specialist with the InterTribal Buffalo Council. </p>

<p> I always acknowledge that I am a mother first, before I am anything else. _Han Mitakuyepi, Anpetu Waste'! Sung Gleska Akan Ka Win, Wakpa Waste' ematahan na Cankpa Wakpa elwati na Cante' Waste' nape ciyuzapi_.  Hello, my relatives. It is a good day!  My colonized name is Summer Afraid of Hawk, my Lakota name is She Rides a Spotted Horse. I come from the Good River, now currently known as the Cheyenne River Reservation in North central South Dakota and I live in the community of Cherry Creek, Bigfoot's (Chief Spotted Elk) people. </p>

# ESIIL Stars Program

<p> Through the ESIIL Stars program, I am excited to learn about creating code and how Earth Data Science can be helpful in Indian Country. </p>

<p> I would like to look at habitat suitability models for buffalo or I would like to compare vegitation density or diversity between buffalo pastures and cattle pastures. </p>
