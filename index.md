<p> I always acknowledge that I am a mother first, before I am anything else. *Han Mitakuyepi, Anpetu Waste'! Sung Gleska Akan Ka Win, Wakpa Waste' ematahan na Cankpa Wakpa elwati na Cante' Waste' nape ciyuzapi.*   Hello, my relatives. It is a good day!  My colonized name is Summer Afraid of Hawk, my Lakota name is She Rides a Spotted Horse. I come from the Good River, now currently known as the Cheyenne River Reservation in North central South Dakota and I live in the community of Cherry Creek, Bigfoot's (Chief Spotted Elk) people. </p>
